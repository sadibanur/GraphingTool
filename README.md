# GraphingTool

This is a simple application which allows a user to draw simple graphs with circles for vertices and straight lines as edges between the vertices. The program also labels the number of the nodes to identify the type of it. The primary purpose of this tool is to make it easier for the users. I have used python tkinter library to design the interface.
